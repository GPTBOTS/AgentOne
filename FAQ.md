## Installation

### If I'm not using the Chrome browser, how can I use this extension?

You need to first check if your browser is based on the Chromium kernel. Among the mainstream browsers in the world today, those based on the Chromium kernel include the following:

Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Arc, OpenAI Atlas, Comet, 360, QQ, Sogou, Samsung Internet.

Browsers with the Chromium kernel can generally use this extension.

If you are using Microsoft Edge, you can directly visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/agentone/jfimkdckeehgbdegkefjofmeleocomad) and install it for use.

If you are using other browsers, you need to install it via the `.crx` file according to the respective browser's relevant regulations.

Download the `.crx` file [here](https://github.com/GPTBOTS/AgentOne/releases); downloading the version with the `latest` tag is sufficient.
