## How We Use Your Information

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All chat history and user settings are stored **locally** in your browser
- Data is stored using Chrome's storage API with standard browser security measures
- Your data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless explicitly required for AI processing

### Data Transmission

- We use secure HTTPS connections for all network communications
- We do not store or log the content of your AI conversations on our servers

## Third-Party Services

This extension may interact with:
- **AI Service Providers**: Your queries are sent to AI service providers (e.g., GPTBots) for processing
- These third-party services have their own privacy policies governing the use of your data
- We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any AI services you connect to
